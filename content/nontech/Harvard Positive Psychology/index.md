## Introduction



### Extraordinary successful students of Harvard MBAs

1. **They really believe in themselves. The sense of confidence.**
   - They thought they could do well. They were driven. They were motivated. They thought "I'm going to make it, I'm going to succeed."
2. **They were always asking questions.**
   - Always asking questions, initially of their boss, later of their employees, of their partner, children, parents, friends, they were always asking question. They are always at the state of curiosity, always looking up, opening up, wanting to understand the world more. They didn't say "Now I have my MBA. That's it. I know enough." They were life-long learners. They were always asking questions.



### Change

Change is the most important thing. Do work your talk. Give a due time to write down your change, so that you need to change before that time.
